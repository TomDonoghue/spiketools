    Notes
    -----
    This approach shuffles spikes by creating bins of varying length and then
    circularly shuffling within those bins.
    This should disturb the spike to spike structure in a dynamic way while also
    conserving structure uniformly across the distribution of lags.
    This function can be a little slow when running a lot.
    The main holdup is `np.roll` (unclear if / how to optimize).
    The next biggest hold up is converting the spike train to spike times.
